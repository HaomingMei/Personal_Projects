# ================= OS/Junk files =================
# macOS
.DS_Store
# Windows
Thumbs.db

# ================= IDE metadata =================
# STM32CubeIDE / Eclipse files
.metadata/
.settings/
*.launch
*.mxproject
*.project
.cproject
# Remote Systems Temp
RemoteSystemsTempFiles/
# VSCode
.vscode/
# Other IDE/editor folders (optional)
.idea/
# Environment/config
*.settings.xml

# ================= STM32CubeMX project =================
# You usually commit the .ioc file; do not ignore it unless you want to regenerate each time.
# Uncomment if you want to ignore CubeMX backups/temp files:
# *.ioc~ 

# ================= Build output / Debug folders =================
# Ignore Debug/ and Release/ folders anywhere:
**/Debug/
**/Release/

# If your project has specific build folders (e.g., under CM4/Debug or CM7/Debug):
# CM4/Debug/
# CM7/Debug/
# (The generic pattern **/Debug/ above covers these.)

# Also ignore other build directories if present:
**/Binaries/
**/build/
**/Build/

# ================= Compiled/intermediate files =================
# Object files, dependency files, compiler output
**/*.o
**/*.obj
**/*.d      # dependency files generated by GCC
**/*.su     # disassembly or debug session files
**/*.lst    # listing files
**/*.elf
**/*.bin
**/*.hex
**/*.map
**/*.axf
**/*.out
**/*.axf

# Makefile-generated lists
**/objects.mk
**/objects.list
**/sources.mk

# ================= Logs / temp =================
**/*.log
**/*.tmp

# ================= Backup or temp =================
*~    # editor backup files
# vim swap files
*.swp
# emacs backup
*~

# ================= Optional: User-specific config =================
# If you have local config or environment files you don't want to track:
*.env
# For example, ignore keys or secrets:
# *.key

# ================= Note on source/Drivers =================
# We assume you WANT to commit your source code and driver folders,
# e.g., Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/, Core/Src/, Core/Inc/, etc.
# Therefore, do NOT include patterns like Drivers/ or Core/ here.
# If you have generated code you prefer not to commit (and instead regenerate via CubeMX),
# add specific ignore patterns for those paths.

# ================= Example if your repository root is one level above Embedded/RTOS_Project =================
# If your Git root is higher, and your STM32 project lives under Embedded/RTOS_Project, you might need:
# Embedded/RTOS_Project/**/Debug/
# Embedded/RTOS_Project/**/Release/
# Embedded/RTOS_Project/**/*.o
# etc.
# But when this .gitignore is at the STM32 project root, the simpler patterns above suffice.
